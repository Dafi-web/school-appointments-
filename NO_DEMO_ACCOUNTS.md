# Demo Accounts Removed ✅

## 📋 What Changed

✅ **Demo accounts seeding is now DISABLED**
- No automatic creation of admin accounts
- No automatic creation of teacher accounts  
- No automatic creation of student accounts
- Database will start empty (no pre-populated users)

## 🔐 Why?

**Security Best Practice:**
- Production systems should not have default/demo credentials
- Prevents unauthorized access with well-known passwords
- Forces proper account setup
- Reduces security vulnerabilities

```

**Follow the prompts:**
```
Enter admin email: admin@yourschool.com
Enter admin password: YourSecurePassword123
Enter admin full name: System Administrator

✅ Admin account created successfully!
```

Then login at: http://localhost:5173/login

### **Option 2: Register & Upgrade** (Quick)

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Register as student:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/register
   - Create account (will be student role)

3. **Upgrade to admin in MongoDB:**
   - Open MongoDB Compass
