- [ ] Wait for automatic redeploy

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test Registration
- [ ] Visit your Vercel URL
- [ ] Click "Register"
- [ ] Create a student account
- [ ] Verify successful registration

### Test Login
- [ ] Login with created account
- [ ] Should redirect to student dashboard
- [ ] Verify user info displays correctly

### Test Appointments
- [ ] Try to create an appointment
- [ ] Check if appointment appears
- [ ] Refresh page - data should persist

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel is correct
- [ ] Ensure backend URL ends with `/api`
- [ ] Check if backend is running (visit `/api/health`)

### If Backend Has Errors
- [ ] Check Render logs
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Check MongoDB connection string
- [ ] Ensure MongoDB IP whitelist is `0.0.0.0/0`

### If Database Connection Fails
- [ ] Go to MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Check Network Access settings
- [ ] Ensure `0.0.0.0/0` is whitelisted
- [ ] Verify connection string is correct
- [ ] Check username/password in connection string
